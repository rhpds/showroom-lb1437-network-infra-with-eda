=== Lab Access

To access lab resources, go to: {lab_url}

You will be prompted for a password, which will be provided to you by your lab instructor.

Next, you will be prompted for your name and email address. The values you submit here will be used to get you back into your same environment if anything happens with your PC.

When you reach the "Workbench Information" screen, you are ready to move on.

IMPORTANT: It's highly recommended to put your workbench in its own browser window, in order to have these instructions on one half of your screen and the workbench on the other.

=== Lab Topology

This is the environment you will be working in:

image::00_topology.png[topology]

We will primarily be working with `rtr1`, and sometimes `rtr2`. We are not going to log into `rtr3`, but it's relevant in that it's the OSPF neighbor for `rtr1`. We are not using `rtr4`.

All 4 devices are Cisco routers running IOS-XE.

If you're unfamiliar, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) are common routing protocols. Knowledge of how OSPF and BGP work is not required to participate in this lab.
