== Accessing VSCode

NOTE: *It's highly recommended to put your workbench in its own browser window, in order to have these instructions on one half of your screen and the workbench on the other.*

When you get assigned your student workbench, you will have a couple links available to you. For now, we are only interested in the “VS Code access” section, similar to what's shown below:

image::0_vscode.png[vscode]

Click on the WebUI link to access the VSCode environment. You will be prompted for a password; use the one displayed on your assignment page.

Once you are in:

1. Go to File > Open Folder… and select `/home/student/telemetry/` (the default is `/home/student/` so be sure to click on `telemetry` in the center pop-up to fill in the rest), click OK.  
2. The page reloads. You can select “Yes, I trust the authors”.  
3. Go to Terminal > New Terminal

You should now have a screen that looks like this:

[#connect]
== Router connectivity and existing configurations

In your terminal, test that you can SSH to rtr1. You should not be prompted for a password as SSH keys have been set up ahead of time.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rtr1
----

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
show version
----

TIP: Press [Space] a few times to get through all the output.

There are a couple of lines in this output worth noting:

[source]
----
Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 17.14.01a
[...]
cisco C8000V (VXE) processor (revision VXE) with 1955292K/3075K bytes of memory.
[...]
----

We can see that we are working with a virtual Cisco 8000V router running IOS-XE 17.14.01a.

We'll also look at some configuration that has been pre-applied.

Run the following command:
[source,role=execute]
----
show running-config interface Tunnel0
----

You should see (your `tunnel destination` IP may be different):
[source]
----
rtr1#show running-config interface Tunnel0
Building configuration...

Current configuration : 184 bytes
!
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 10.100.100.1 255.255.255.0
 ip mtu 1476
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
 ip ospf 1 area 0
 tunnel source GigabitEthernet1
 tunnel destination 172.16.73.13
end
----

This shows us that there is an interface on `rtr1` called `Tunnel0` that is involved in OSPF. The OSPF and interface configurations have already been applied.

Next, run:
[source,role=execute]
----
show running-config | section router bgp
----

You should see:

[source]
----
rtr1#show running-config | section router bgp
router bgp 65000
 bgp router-id 192.168.1.1
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 timers bgp 5 15
 neighbor 10.200.200.2 remote-as 65001
 neighbor 10.200.200.2 ebgp-multihop 255
[truncated]
----

This shows us that there is BGP configuration on `rtr1` that has also already been applied.

We'll work with these pre-applied configurations later.

Exit your SSH session before moving on.

[source,role=execute]
----
exit
----

If desired, repeat these steps on `rtr2`. You should see similar, but slightly different, configurations applied there.
