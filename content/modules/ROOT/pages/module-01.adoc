[#codeserver]
== Accessing code-server

When you get assigned your student workbench, you will have a couple links available to you. For now, we are only interested in the “VS Code access” section, similar to what’s shown below:

NOTE: Please ignore any links at the top of the page to the exercises/deck as these are for a different workshop; we are just borrowing the lab setup from it.

Click on the WebUI link to access the VSCode environment. Once you are in:

1. Go to File > Open Folder… and choose /home/student (this should be filled in by default), click OK.  
2. The page reloads. You can select “Yes, I trust the authors”.  
3. Go to Terminal > New Terminal

You should now have a screen that looks like this:

You may want to utilize your browser’s zoom function at this point to be able to see the text more clearly.

[#connect]
== Router connectivity and existing configurations

In your terminal, test that you can SSH to rtr1 and rtr2. While logged in, find out the IOS-XE version being used and view their BGP configurations (commands to do that are provided below). You should not be prompted for a password as SSH keys have been set up ahead of time.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ssh rtr1
----

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
show version
----

On the first output line you should see:

`Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 17.14.01a`

Then:

`show running-config | sec router bgp`

You should see:

[source,textinfo]
----
router bgp 65000  
bgp router-id 192.168.1.1  
bgp log-neighbor-changes  
neighbor 10.200.200.2 remote-as 65001  
neighbor 10.200.200.2 ebgp-multihop 255  
[...]
----

Exit and repeat for rtr2. The BGP configuration will be slightly different.
