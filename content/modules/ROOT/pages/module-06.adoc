= Extend the scope

There are no instructions for this exercise. You now have a working telemetry lab where you can try out any ideas you have for things you'd like to do in your own environment.

Here are some ideas:

* There are two other routers in the environment, rtr3 and rtr4. Try involving those.
* These routers are also configured to use OSPF. Try monitoring for OSPF changes. Refer to the lab topology diagram.
* A good use case for switches is to monitor whether a port is supposed to be shutdown or not. You can mimic that on these routers by using Loopback interfaces.

Have fun!
